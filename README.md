Quantifying the influence of imputing missing values of Bike-Sharing-System

Abstract
Missing data is one of the most common challenges experienced by researchers, data analysts,
and data scientists. Therefore, managing missing data is an essential task before obtaining any
results; otherwise, results may not be valid. In this thesis, we demonstrate various imputation
methods using the MCAR missingness pattern in the bike sharing dataset. On the other hand,
bike sharing systems have witnessed exceptional growth and significant attention in the trans-
portation domain in recent years. However, it experiences a prevalent issue of missing data due
to various reasons, such as the failure of data acquisition devices or the userâ€™s participation,
among others. The missing data led to increased uncertainty in the modeling and planning of
bike transportation systems, so obtaining complete imputing of the missing data is a crucial task.
This study quantifies the influence of missing values in bike-sharing data using various standard
imputation methodologies by introducing distinct missingness proportions. To experiment, I
collected a real-world complete bicycling dataset from New York City (Citi Bikes), and for the
simulation, I used a common algorithm to introduce missing values for univariate and multivari-
ate imputation techniques.
Experiment conducted with heterogeneous data and realistic missingness condition MCAR,Using
both univariate and multivariate imputation methods when both training and testing are affected
by missing data. Each imputation strategy is evaluated regarding the imputation quality and
the impact it has on a subsequent ML task. This thesis findings provide vital insights into the
presence of a variety of imputation methodologies under realistic conditions.
